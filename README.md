# AstarPathFinder

Interactive pathfinder using the A* search algorithm. <br/>

Set a start(blue) point and an end(purple) point along with any desired amount of walls(black) that act as obstacles 
for the Pathfinder to go around. <br/>

The path finder will return with the shortest path from the start point to the end point. Current version uses Manhatten distance as 
its heuristic. 

The final path to the end point(if possible) is marked in red. Tiles which were explored but not taken
in the final path by the algorithm are displayed in green
while the tiles that the pathfinder was yet to visit are displayed in an olive color. <br/>
